# 🏫 React Social

This is a very simple react project that simulates social media apps.


## 🏃‍♂️ My Journey

**This app was built around May 2022, despite the commits saying otherwise..** 

Before this project, I had only programmed client applications imperatively, which is why I despised front-end development 💀. Nonetheless, React came to rescue - I built this project to learn this amazing library's fundamentals, and I ended up enjoying it.

Although very simple, this project came out nicely!
